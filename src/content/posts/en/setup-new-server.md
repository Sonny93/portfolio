## Cleaning up my tech lab: the server setup I use now

After going through one throwaway, badly configured server too many, reinstalled in a hurry after a botched first `sudo apt install`, I finally sat down and wrote out, once and for all, the procedure I now follow for every new server. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's exactly the kind of "clean" baseline that always gets pushed to later, until the day a slightly-too-simple password ends up giving way.

So here's how I go from a freshly installed Ubuntu, reachable as root with a password, to something sane: SSH-key-only access, a dedicated user, a working Docker setup, and a minimum amount of hardening (fail2ban, automatic security updates, and a MOTD that actually gives a real glance at the machine's state).

## Step 1: the SSH key, on my machine

It all starts locally, not on the server. If I don't already have a key for this project, I generate a new one in ed25519, more compact and stronger than RSA.

**On Linux or macOS**, in a terminal:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sonny@techlab"
```

I keep the default path (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), unless I want a key dedicated to this specific machine. I always set a passphrase, and add it to my ssh-agent so I don't have to retype it on every connection:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**On Windows**, from Windows 10/11, the OpenSSH client is built in natively. Just open PowerShell and run the exact same command:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sonny@techlab"
```

The key is generated in `C:\Users\<youraccount>\.ssh\id_ed25519`. To add it to the SSH agent (sometimes disabled by default on Windows):

```powershell
Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519
```

If `ssh-keygen` isn't recognized, the OpenSSH client isn't installed: `Settings > Apps > Optional Features > Add a Feature > OpenSSH Client`. A more visual alternative for those who prefer a GUI: PuTTYgen, the key generation tool bundled with PuTTY.

## Step 2: a user that isn't root

Staying logged in as root permanently is the kind of habit you end up regretting the day a badly written script does something reckless with full privileges. So I create a dedicated user, `sonny`:

```bash
ssh root@SERVER_IP
adduser sonny
usermod -aG sudo sonny
```

A quick test to make sure it works before going further:

```bash
su - sonny
sudo whoami   # should return "root"
```

## Step 3: pushing my key to the server

Always from my local machine, never from the server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub sonny@SERVER_IP
```

If `ssh-copy-id` isn't available, the manual version does exactly the same thing:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh sonny@SERVER_IP "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

On PowerShell, `ssh-copy-id` simply doesn't exist. The equivalent:

```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | ssh sonny@SERVER_IP "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

And above all: I test the key-based connection **before** touching anything else.

```bash
ssh sonny@SERVER_IP
```

## Step 4: Docker and Docker Compose

Nothing complicated here, the official script does the job cleanly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

The `docker compose` plugin (v2) comes bundled automatically. A `docker compose version` is enough to confirm it.

What really matters is the post-installation part, often forgotten even though it's clearly documented by Docker:
👉 https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

Two things worth remembering from that guide:

```bash
# Run docker without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker sonny
# (requires re-logging in, or running "newgrp docker")

# Start automatically on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```

Final check:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## Step 5: closing the door to root and passwords

This is the step where things can really go wrong if you move too fast. **I only do this after confirming that key-based login with `sonny` works.** Otherwise, it's the kind of mistake that costs a trip to the hosting provider's emergency console.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Lines to have:

```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

I also check that no file in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` overrides this:

```bash
grep -r "PasswordAuthentication\|PermitRootLogin" /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ 2>/dev/null
```

Before restarting the service, I test the syntax (it saves a lot of cold sweat):

```bash
sudo sshd -t
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

And above all: I open a **new** SSH session without closing the current one, to make sure everything is fine before cutting the thread still connecting me to the server.

## Step 6: ufw, the firewall that too often gets skipped

A server that's freshly hardened on the SSH side but has no active firewall is still a machine listening on every port that installed packages decide to open without asking. `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) covers the essentials: keeping the attack surface down to what's strictly necessary.

```bash
sudo apt install -y ufw
```

**Critical point, don't get this order backwards**: I allow SSH *before* enabling ufw, otherwise I lock myself out of the machine.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable
```

Check:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

From there, I open ports case by case depending on what's running on the machine, never wider than necessary:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

### The Docker trap: ufw doesn't see any of it

This is the kind of detail that gives a false sense of security. Docker doesn't respect ufw rules: it manipulates iptables chains directly (through its own `DOCKER-USER` chain), and it does so *after* ufw has already laid down its own rules. Concrete result: a container started with `-p 8080:8080` stays reachable from the outside **even if ufw is blocking port 8080**, because Docker inserts its own NAT rules ahead of ufw's.

Two ways around it:

- **Don't publish what doesn't need to be published.** If a service only needs to be reachable from a reverse proxy on the same machine, I bind it to `127.0.0.1` instead of all interfaces:

```bash
# Only reachable locally, ufw doesn't even need to get involved
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
```

- **Force Docker to respect ufw**, with [ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker), which adds the necessary rules to `DOCKER-USER` so published ports actually go through ufw's filtering. Useful when I genuinely need to expose ports directly.

Either way, the habit worth building: after every `docker compose up` with published ports, check what's actually exposed with `sudo iptables -L DOCKER-USER -n`, or just scan the server from the outside.

### Setting up ufw-docker

Here's how I install [ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) on a server that already has ufw active (step 6 above):

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker/master/ufw-docker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ufw-docker

sudo ufw-docker install
sudo ufw reload
```

The `ufw reload` isn't optional: `ufw-docker install` writes the new rules to `/etc/ufw/after.rules` (and `after6.rules` for IPv6), but they only get loaded into iptables on reload. A plain `systemctl restart ufw` doesn't always pick them up.

I check that the `DOCKER-USER` chain is actually populated:

```bash
sudo iptables -L DOCKER-USER -n --line-numbers
```

If it's empty after the reload, `sudo ufw-docker check` gives a more precise diagnosis than digging through iptables by hand.

**Behavior once installed**: any container published as `0.0.0.0:PORT:PORT` becomes unreachable from the outside by default, without touching the mapping at all. I verify it with a throwaway container:

```bash
docker run -d --name test-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```

```bash
# from ANOTHER machine, not the server
curl -m 3 http://SERVER_IP/
# curl: (28) Connection timed out
```

The port is still "published" as far as Docker is concerned (`docker ps` shows it), but external traffic gets dropped by the `DOCKER-USER` chain before it ever reaches the container. Useful for services I want reachable only from other containers on the same Docker network, without touching `docker-compose.yml`.

**To expose a specific container to the world**, an explicit allow is needed:

```bash
sudo ufw-docker allow test-nginx 80
```

And to revert:

```bash
sudo ufw-docker delete allow test-nginx 80
```

One thing to watch: `ufw-docker allow` opens the port to **all of the Internet**, not just a trusted IP. To restrict access to a specific source instead of the whole world, I prefer a targeted `ufw route` rule:

```bash
sudo ufw route allow proto tcp from TRUSTED_IP to any port 80
```

This trusted-IP restriction works fine for personal access or a handful of known clients. For a public-facing service (website, open API), there's no fixed list of IPs to allow ahead of time: either `ufw-docker allow` opens up to the whole world and the VPS's IP becomes directly visible and scannable by anyone, or a proxy sits in front to mask that IP. That's exactly what I cover in [Hiding my VPS's IP behind Cloudflare](/en/blog/cloudflare-proxy-vps): public traffic goes through Cloudflare, and ufw only lets in Cloudflare's IP ranges instead of the whole Internet, using the same `ufw route allow` logic as above but applied to their ranges instead of a single IP.

Cleaning up the test container once the check is done:

```bash
docker rm -f test-nginx
```

And if I ever want to uninstall everything and go back to Docker's native behavior (so, back to the original trap: published ports exposed with no filtering):

```bash
sudo ufw-docker uninstall
sudo ufw reload
```

### The hosting provider's firewall, a separate layer

On a server rented from a provider like Contabo, OVH, or Hetzner, there's often a network firewall managed from the control panel, completely independent from ufw. Two symmetrical traps here:

- if it's configured wide-open by default, ufw becomes my only real line of defense, so it better not have gaps;
- if it's misconfigured on the provider's side (a rule blocking a port I actually need), I can burn a lot of time debugging on the server while the block is happening upstream, in the panel, before traffic ever reaches the machine.

Useful habit when a port doesn't respond as expected: check `ufw status`, check the Docker/iptables rules, **and** check the hosting provider's panel firewall before assuming it's an application bug.

## Step 7: fail2ban, because bots never get tired

As soon as a server is exposed to the Internet, SSH login attempts start within minutes. Fail2ban doesn't replace a good configuration, but it automatically bans IPs that get too insistent.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
```

I always configure it in a `jail.local`, never in `jail.conf`, which gets overwritten on the slightest update:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[DEFAULT]
bantime  = 1h
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 5
backend  = systemd

[sshd]
enabled  = true
port     = ssh
logpath  = %(sshd_log)s
backend  = %(sshd_backend)s
EOF

sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

To verify it's running and see current bans:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

## Step 8: a MOTD that's actually useful

Ubuntu's default MOTD, with its ESM ads and generic info, doesn't tell me anything. I ended up writing my own, which shows at a glance the last login, RAM state, disk usage, and uptime.

`figlet` is just for the ASCII banner. `wtmpdb` matters more than it looks: starting with `util-linux` 2.40 (Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13+), plain `wtmp` logging is gone and the classic `last` command doesn't work at all without it. This package provides the compatibility shim that keeps `last` functional (used below).

```bash
sudo apt install -y figlet wtmpdb

sudo tee /etc/update-motd.d/99-custom > /dev/null <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
LOGIN_USER=$(logname)
LAST_IP=$(last -n 2 "$LOGIN_USER" | awk 'NR==2{print $3}')
LAST_DATE=$(last -n 2 "$LOGIN_USER" | awk 'NR==2{print $4, $5, $6, $7}')
echo "$(figlet $(logname | sed 's/./\u&/'))"
echo -e "\e[44m\e[97m  🔐 Last login: $LAST_DATE from $LAST_IP  \e[0m"
echo ""
echo "📅 $(date)"
echo "🖥️  $(hostname | sed 's/./\u&/') - Linux $(uname -r)"
echo "💾 RAM: $(free -h | awk '/Mem/{print $3"/"$2}') ($(free | awk '/Mem/{printf "%.0f%%", $3/$2*100}'))"
echo "💿 Disk: $(df -h / | awk 'NR==2{print $3"/"$2" ("$5")"}')"
echo "🌡️  Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo ""
EOF
sudo chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/99-custom
```

If I want a truly minimal display, without the distro's default scripts adding to mine: script names vary by image (Ubuntu, Debian, provider), for example `10-help-text`, `50-motd-news`, `10-uname`, `92-unattended-upgrades`. Easiest is to list what's running and disable everything but mine:

```bash
ls /etc/update-motd.d/

for f in /etc/update-motd.d/*; do
  [[ "$f" == */99-custom ]] || sudo chmod -x "$f"
done
```

Some providers (OVH, DigitalOcean, etc.) don't use `update-motd.d` at all but a static `/etc/motd` file, shown in addition to the dynamic one. Clear it if needed:

```bash
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/motd
```

No need to reconnect to see the result:

```bash
run-parts /etc/update-motd.d/
```

## Step 9: security updates, without thinking about it

This is probably the most underestimated step. A server you forget to update sooner or later ends up dragging along a known vulnerability. `unattended-upgrades` automatically applies security patches, with no manual intervention.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
```

Then I check the configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
```

The essentials to have uncommented (usually already the case by default on Ubuntu):

```
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
        "${distro_id}ESMApps:${distro_codename}-apps-security";
        "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}-infra-security";
};

Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";
Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "false";
```

I deliberately leave `Automatic-Reboot` set to `false`: on a machine running containers, I'd rather keep control over restarts than end up with services cut off in the middle of the night.

One last thing to check, in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades`:

```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```

And to make sure everything's properly wired up, a dry run:

```bash
sudo unattended-upgrade --dry-run --debug
```

## The end result

Once these nine steps are done, I have a server that:

- no longer accepts root or password-based login,
- only lets through what's strictly needed, thanks to ufw,
- automatically bans IPs that get too pushy on SSH,
- applies its security patches without me having to think about it,
- shows me a real summary of its state on every connection,
- and runs Docker cleanly, ready to host projects, without published ports quietly bypassing the firewall.

It's far from exhaustive on the security front (monitoring and backups are still missing), but it's the baseline I now build every server on, and it saves me a huge amount of time on every new machine.
